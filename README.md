 Calculate exit route (from I to G) using branch and bound algorithm.
 
 ### Implementation
 The program is made with python3 and uses numpy.
 In each iteration the current path is printed.
 
 In the first lines of code the maze is defined. One can modify the maze (size and arrangement) but not its dimensions.
 The program should run anyway.
 Performance has not been the goal so be carefull with the size.
